Travel Log

Log for users to keep track of travels and their bucketlist.

Concept:

I am creating an application that allows users to have a forum to list destinations they would like to travel to as well as keep track of cities/countries they have been to. A user is able to utilize Google Maps in order to input the locations they have traveled to ("places"), and use basic CRUD functionality in order to create, edit, and delete listings in their bucketlist. The bucketlist displays places the user has publicized they are interested in going as well as other recent user's publications of where they would like to go in the future.

Tech:

HTML/CSS
JavaScript
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Google Maps API

User Story:

An idividual who likes to travel uses this app in order to keep track of their vacations using a map to display all the places they have been to with markers/pins. Additionally, the user is able to list places that they would eventually like to travel to by creating and adding destinations to their bucketlist. 

An example of a bucketlist listing: 

    Location: New Orleans
    Description: For jazzfest, beignets, and mardi-gras

Other users/friends of this individual will be able to see the created bucketlist destination as well as indicate that they are also potentially interested in traveling to the destination.

Places an individual has indicated interest in will be kept track of along with the locations they themselves have created to add to the bucketlist.

Key Challenges:

-Google Maps: ability for a user to make markers in the front end + have them stored into mongo
